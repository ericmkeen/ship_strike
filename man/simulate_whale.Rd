\title{Simulate whale density (mean / CV)}
\usage{
simulate_whale(grids, d_mean = 0.001, d_cv = 0.3)
}
\arguments{
\item{grids}{The spatial grid to use as the basis for the density surface,
as produced by \code{shipstrike::make_grid()} (see documentation).}

\item{d_mean}{The mean density (animals per square km)}

\item{d_cv}{The co-efficient of variation (CV) in density.}
}
\value{
The \code{grids} object, with new columns \code{d_mean} and \code{d_cv}.
}
\description{
A simple function that creates a spatial grid of whale densities
for use in simulating a shipping impacts assessment.
